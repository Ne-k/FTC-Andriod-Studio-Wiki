This wiki is just a walkthrough on how to set up and use Andriod Studio with First Tech Challenge.

You can view the full Wiki at the tab right next to Projects or [click here](https://github.com/Ne-k/FTC-Andriod-Studio-Wiki/wiki)

# Side note
> The wiki is being worked on by a person who **just** joined FTC and made the wiki just because I couldn't find any straightfoward sources on the internet. If you have any issues, feel free to put it in [Issues](https://github.com/Ne-k/FTC-Andriod-Studio-Wiki/issues), there's a chance that I ran into it when testing
